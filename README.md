# dotfiles

Repository for my personal dotfiles. My operating system is PopOS and any Ubuntu/Debian distro should work with little effort.

Using dotter, the config files *should* be placed exactly where they're supposed to.

## Terminal
 - Alacritty
 - NuShell
 - Starship
 - Zoxide
 - LSDelux
 - Bat
 - Fzf

## Other
 - Obsidian


# Operation
```bash
home-manager -f dotfiles/home.nix switch
```
